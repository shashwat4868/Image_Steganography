# Image_Steganography
### Image Steganography using an Edge Based Embedding Technique - 
* The aim of this project is to execute a information hiding method based on Edge Embedding Technique and LSB (Least Significant Bit) Technique on digital images. Moreover, traditional AES Encryption is also performed to provide an extra level of security to the information before embedding it to the digital image making it very tough for attackers to decode the actual piece of information from just a simple looking image.

### Methodology -
1. Text Compression
2. AES Encryption
3. Text Embedding in Image
4. Text Retrieving from Image
5. AES Decryption
6. Text Decompression
