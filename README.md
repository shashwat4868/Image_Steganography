# Image_Steganography
### Image Steganography using an Edge Based Embedding Technique - 
* The aim of this project is to execute a novel information hiding method based on Edge Embedding Technique and LSB (Least Significant Bit) Technique on digital images. Moreover, traditional AES Encryption will also be performed to provide an extra level of security to the information before embedding it to the digital image making it very tough for attackers to decode the actual piece of information from just a simple looking image.
